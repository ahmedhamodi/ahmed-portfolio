                            <h2>Electric Car Club</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>I joined the Bluevale Electric Car Club in the 2013-2014 school year. There were a lot of experienced grade 11 and 12 students who were eager to help out the newcomers. I tried my best to learn as much as I could in grade 9, taking part in as many processes as I was able to, staying after school on our designated days and working hours upon hours on the cars. After my first year, I knew quite a bit about the processes such as fabricating components, measuring and cutting out sheet metal for the sides of the cars, aligning the steering mechanism, and the electrical of the car.</p>

                        <p>In grade 10, I continued to refine these skills and actually took on projects individually and pushed them forward to ensure the progress on the cars continued. One of my main projects over grade 10 was designing and building the back end of one of our new cars we were making that year. Throughout the course of the year, the design changed and went through numerous design changes. Once the final drawings were submitted and approved, I then went onto building and fabricating the design. This was then assembled with the rest of the car, and ended up winning the Waterloo race that year.</p>

                        <p>In grade 11, I became one of the leaders of the club, helping direct and lead the newcomers, while taking part in the designing, developing and building of the cars. Also, in grade 11, I was one of the few individuals who actually got to drive the car in the race. To begin with, our team took on the challenge of creating a front wheel driving car, which has never been done before in the Waterloo Region area. Historically, for over 8 years, all the schools in the region used two wheels at the front to steer, while one in the back with the motor attached to it. I, along with a team of roughly 10 individuals, took on this challenge to redesign the car such that we could have one wheel in the front for steering and propelling the car forward with the motor, while 2 in the back for balance and load support. This project took some very big bumps and delays, and at one point our teacher supervisor was considering canceling the project. However, to counter the delays and bumps, we worked more and more days, more and more hours to ensure this project was moving forward at a good rate. We would stay after school on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 3-4 hours on each of those days to make this project happen. Ultimately, we finished it just in time, and barely had much testing done on the finished product. We brought this car to the Waterloo Race in which it finished first, slightly ahead of our other car which finished second.</p>

                        <p>As I briefly mentioned above, I actually drove this year in the 12V Race. Now what does that mean exactly? Well, at the UoW electric vehicle challenge, there are two races, a 12 volt and 24 volt race. We had two cars drive in the 24V race, and only 1 in the 12V race. Each car has 3 drivers. I was one of the three drivers selected for the 12V race. This is a huge accomplishment for me, and I wasn't going to waste it. Our car won the 12V race, and our two cars in the 24V race finished first and second. On top of those accomplishments, we won the Engineering Design award to finish up the triple win this year. THe 2015-2016 year was a huge success for Bluevale Electric Car racing, and we look forward to another great year in the upcoming 2016-2017 season.</p>

                            <h2>Federal Provincial Simulation</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>The Fed Prov simulation occurs once an year, and requires months of preparation before hand to ensure we are knowledgeable about the topics being discussed, and have an opinion for our province that we are representing. This year, I was put into the Finance group for Ontario, and I took on the role of Deputy Minister. As the deputy minister, it was my role to help the Minister with leading our team, and help in researching and formulation opinions on the topics being discussed.</p>

                        <p>The topics we discussed this year were Universal Income, Reform of the CPP, Allocation of Infrastructure Spending, and lastly Equalization Payment Reform. For each of the topics mentioned, my team and I did thorough research on Ontario's stance for each of these topics, and formulating a paragraph response on our opinion to send to the prime minister. This year I took on the lead researcher role, and spent numerous hours creating pages of research to use in our debate as evidence and proof to support what we wanted to happen. Also, we were able to see what the other provinces proposed to happen for each of these opinions approximately a week before the meeting, so we were able to get some evidence to disprove some of their opinions.</p>

                        <p>Overall, the experience opened my eyes to the world of politics and the decisions being made every day by our Prime Minister and all other people associated with the decisions being made.</p>

                            <h2>Programming - Website</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>This website has given me a good understanding of the type of work I'd be doing if I decided to follow through with Software Engineering, or a similar program. Throughout the journey on this project, I have learned that this is something that I'm truly interested in, and that only motivates me further to keep working on more opportunities and other projects to better enhance my knowledge of programming.</p>

                        <p>This website uses a mixture of HTML, CSS and JQuery, all languages I am familiar with, some more then others, through what I learned at school and on my own time. HTML and CSS are some of my better languages, and is where I've spent most of my time fine tuning my skills there. Other languages I know are Java and Python, in which I am moderate with. JQuery is one of the newer languages I've tried to learn, and am still a beginner with.</p>

                        <p>As I continue with my programming projects, continue learning new languages and fine tuning the ones I currently know, I will be able to make bigger and better projects, hopefully making mobile applications and modifying this website even more. However, all that will come in due time.</p>

                        <p>Coding this website has given me the opportunity to explore a potential field I am considering studying, and that's been very helpful to myself.</p>
