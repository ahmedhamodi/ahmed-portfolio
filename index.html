							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>

						<p><!-- Hello. My name is Ahmed Hamodi, and I am currently a grade 12 student at Bluevale Collegiate Institute in Ontario, Canada. I have a growing interest in making a positive change in the world around us, and I excel at doing so through my numerous avenues of influence. One of my favourite things that I do is program. I thoroughly enjoy programming projects and seeing them come to life. This website is one of the projects I decided to begin over my grade 11 summer. Another thing I enjoy doing is volunteering. Over my high school journey, I have volunteered over 600 hours. Lastly, I enjoy refereeing soccer, in which I've officiated over 500 games with the Ontario Soccer Association. -->

								<h3>Production Operator, Summer Student</h3>
								<h5><em>Aeryon Labs Inc.</em></h5>

								<p>As a production operator for a high tech company like Aeryon Labs, I excel at many different skill sets and possess the ability to effectively convey proper work habits and skills to any other job in similar industries.</p>

								<p>During my time at Aeryon, I've learned a lot of the fundamental skills like time management, responsibility, leadership, teamwork and determination. I've been given projects and assignments individually, and with a team, which has helped develop my skills of working under a time line, taking responsibility for anything that I do, and working with a team. One of the cool benefits for working with Aeryon was that it was a small, closely knit group of people, and majority of the staff were all very close by and easy to talk to. Although I worked as a production operator, I had a lot of encounters with other areas of the company, such as the engineers (software, mechanical and hardware engineers), quality inspection and upper management which has given me a better and greater understanding of how a company is run.</p>

								<h3>Soccer Referee</h3>
								<h5><em>Ontario Soccer Association</em></h5>

								<p>As a soccer referee, I learn and demonstrate great ability to work with a variety of people, which is broken down into three main groups: the players, the coaches, and the spectators. When dealing with these three groups, you have different obligations and responsibilities towards them. My main obligations go towards the players, for example I am responsible for their well being and safety, and to make sure any infringement of that is dealt with accordingly. I am also there to ensure the players play a safe, fair, and fun game. To allow this to happen, I need to be thorough with my understanding of the FIFA Laws of the Game, and I need to be able to enforce the rules in a manner where the game is still fun, but safe and rule abiding.</p>

								<p>Along side these communication skills, I also demonstrate leadership, responsibility and determination through arriving on time, preparing the game sheets/nets/field, and leading the game successfully.</p>

								<h3>Electric Car Club</h3>
								<h5><em>Leader</em></h5>

								<p>Bluevale Collegiate Institute is notorious for their success at both electric vehicle racing events at University of Waterloo and Michigan. At the Bluevale Electric Car Club we design, build, test, and race full size electric cars. I have been apart of this club for my whole high school experience, starting in grade 9, and through that time I have learned a lot regarding the process of building a project of this large scale.</p>

								<p>My role in the club has changed over the years, starting in grade 9 when I was a beginner who didn't know much about making full sized cars from scratch, and barely knowing how to use the tools used in this process. In grade 10 I continued learning new roles and responsibilities, even creating components of the car by myself. In grade 11, I became one of the few leaders of the club, working on new innovative projects that no school in the Waterloo Region has done before. Going into grade 12, I will continue to lead the group to another successful year.</p>

								<h3>Federal Provincial Government Simulation</h3>
								<h5><em>Finance Deputy Minister</em></h5>

								<p>Federal Provincial, Fed Prov for short, is a club at Bluevale Collegiate Institute where we meet on a weekly basis to study, understand and formulate an opinion on serious topics currently being discussed in the Parliament Buildings. These topics include assisted suicide, the first nations mistreatment, and our financial situation. A prime minister is elected, along with people to represent each of the provinces, and one for the first nations people. From here, discussions occur in smaller groups regarding the selected topics.</p>

								<p>I was personally the Finance Deputy Minister for Ontario, and we discussed a variety of subjects including Universal Income, Reform of the CPP, Allocation of Infrastructure Spending, and finally Equalization Payment Reform. Taking part in this club has really opened my eyes to the serious and tough decisions being made by our leaders everyday, and it has been a pleasure to have experienced that.</p>

								<h3>Website</h3>
								<h5><em>Programmer</em></h5>

								<p>I have always had a passion for coding, and often expressed this passion during computer science classes. I would always go above and beyond the required guidelines for projects because I really enjoyed doing it. Over the summer between grade 11 and 12, I didn't have any assignments or projects due, so I felt sort of lost. Sure I had a couple jobs, and I volunteered, but I felt I was missing something. Sure enough, I found something to do, and that was make a website.</p>

								<p>This website was an absolute joy to make, and I really am happy with the result. As you can see, I have a little snapshot of the code, taken on September 3rd, 2016. That segment of code likely looks different now as I am always looking for ways to improve my coding, whether to make it neater, easier to read, optimized or functionally better.</p>

								<p>Making this website really helped me focus on what I want to do in life and after high school. I really do enjoy programming, and will be applying to programs that suit that passion. This website helped open my eyes to the type of things I will be doing after post-secondary education. It has really helped me focus on what I want to do.</p>

								<h3>Peer Tutoring at Bluevale Collegiate Institute</h3>
								<h5><em>Lead Tutor</em></h5>

								<p>I volunteer at the peer tutoring club for Bluevale Collegiate Institute most lunch breaks that I can which is roughly 3 times a week. I find tutoring as one of the biggest accomplishments I have achieved thus far in my life. I have seen the positive impacts it has made in peoples lives, helping individuals achieve their required goals, mark wise. I have seen the progression, I've seen their minds make connections that weren't previously there. I've seen people reach their goals, and I was lucky enough to help them through this. Students come to me in the hallways and thank me for my help and tell me about how they did on their last test, and the improvements they've seen. It absolutely fills me with joy. Sometimes, all it takes is a different set of eyes and a different explanation of concepts to help a student reach their goal. Some teachers don't teach in the way that makes the most sense to every student, so having a tutor who can describe concepts in a different way, can really make a difference.</p>

								<p>Throughout my high school career, I have helped countless students reach new goals and milestones, and I wouldn't give that up for anything else.</p>

								<h3>YMCA School Age Youth Development Program</h3>
								<h5><em>Facilitator</em></h5>

								<p>At the YMCA program, we help students from grades 3-6 (aged 8-12) develop communication skills, physical wellbeing, and mental advancements. We challenge the kids to go out of their comfort zones and push their minds to the next level. Providing them with the right tools to do so, we help them solve problems, help with try new sports and physical activities while helping them communicate with each other. I really enjoy volunteering at this program as we can see kids having fun, learning and experiences new things that they've never done before.</p>

								<p>I've learned a variety of things during my time with the program, like how to deal with kids of younger ages, and how to help get them involved in activities. A lot of these kids are afraid of trying something new because it might not go well or they might not succeed. We have to assure them that it's okay to fail and get back up again, it's okay to not succeed, but you have to try and see if this is something you can enjoy. I learn how to be responsible, as these kids look up to us as role models, and as people they want to be when they grow up. Overall, it's a great volunteering experience to fine tune those skills I've developed through reffing, working and volunteering at other locations.</p>
