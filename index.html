								<h3>Peer Tutoring at Bluevale Collegiate Institute</h3>
								<h5><em>Lead Tutor</em></h5>

								<p>I volunteer at the peer tutoring club for Bluevale Collegiate Institute most lunch breaks that I can which is roughly 3 times a week. I find tutoring as one of the biggest accomplishments I have achieved thus far in my life. I have seen the positive impacts it has made in peoples lives, helping individuals achieve their required goals, mark wise. I have seen the progression, I've seen their minds make connections that weren't previously there. I've seen people reach their goals, and I was lucky enough to help them through this. Students come to me in the hallways and thank me for my help and tell me about how they did on their last test, and the improvements they've seen. It absolutely fills me with joy. Sometimes, all it takes is a different set of eyes and a different explanation of concepts to help a student reach their goal. Some teachers don't teach in the way that makes the most sense to every student, so having a tutor who can describe concepts in a different way, can really make a difference.</p>

								<p>Throughout my high school career, I have helped countless students reach new goals and milestones, and I wouldn't give that up for anything else.</p>

								<h3>YMCA School Age Youth Development Program</h3>
								<h5><em>Facilitator</em></h5>

								<p>At the YMCA program, we help students from grades 3-6 (aged 8-12) develop communication skills, physical wellbeing, and mental advancements. We challenge the kids to go out of their comfort zones and push their minds to the next level. Providing them with the right tools to do so, we help them solve problems, help with try new sports and physical activities while helping them communicate with each other. I really enjoy volunteering at this program as we can see kids having fun, learning and experiences new things that they've never done before.</p>

								<p>I've learned a variety of things during my time with the program, like how to deal with kids of younger ages, and how to help get them involved in activities. A lot of these kids are afraid of trying something new because it might not go well or they might not succeed. We have to assure them that it's okay to fail and get back up again, it's okay to not succeed, but you have to try and see if this is something you can enjoy. I learn how to be responsible, as these kids look up to us as role models, and as people they want to be when they grow up. Overall, it's a great volunteering experience to fine tune those skills I've developed through reffing, working and volunteering at other locations.</p>
