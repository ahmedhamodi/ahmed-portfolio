Elements to add onto Hack the North 2017 section:

Generic additions:
  - talk more about the website, currently hosted on "k4yt3x.com"
  - talk more about the analytics page, currently hosted on "k4yt3x.com/stats"
  - include picture of the team that worked on the project, not just the home page of the website
  - work on one of the following to get more images displayed per element:
  - slideshow effect which changes the displayed image every 10(?) seconds
  - when image is clicked on to expand, add either slideshow effect or a clickable button to cycle through images
  - work on a more technical documentation / subdirectory on my website to further eloborate what this project does as a lot of effort went into it
  - link to devpost that showcases the project (should also add this to JamHacks)

Personal things to do:
  - create a git hub repository to host the HTN website/analytics page on
  - potentially continue to work on and add features to the website for personal practice
  - continue to work with google's API for graph creation, like used on the stats subdirectory of the website
  - if a github repository is set up, potentially link that site when image is clicked to expand OR add another button / clickable link that brings user to that website
