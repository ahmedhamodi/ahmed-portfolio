Elements to add onto Hack the North 2017 section:

Generic additions:
  - include picture of the team that worked on the project, not just the home page of the website
  - work on one of the following to get more images displayed per element:
    - slideshow effect which changes the displayed image every 10(?) seconds
    - when image is clicked on to expand, add either slideshow effect or a clickable button to cycle through images
  - work on a more technical documentation / subdirectory on my website to further eloborate what this project does as a lot of effort went into it

Personal things to do:
  - potentially continue to work on and add features to the website for personal practice
  - continue to work with google's API for graph creation, like used on the stats subdirectory of the website
  - if a github repository is set up, potentially link that site when image is clicked to expand OR add another button / clickable link that brings user to that website
