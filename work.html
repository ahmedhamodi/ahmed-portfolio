                            <h2>Production Operator at Aeryon Labs Inc.</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>Working at Aeryon Labs Inc. has been one of the most rewarding experiences for me. I was truly able to experience a day in the life of a full time worker, committing 40 hours a week, documenting all hours done, documenting all the work I've done, completing Standard Work Instructions for any procedures modified in my two months there, and building components for a sUAS - small unmanned aerial system. I was able to work closely with many of the other employees at Aeryon, being a relatively small company still. I've worked and done small projects directly for engineers, and have encountered and built relationships with quite a few of them. On top of that, I've had the opportunity to work directly with some of the senior engineers, including the senior quality engineer on testing some new items to ensure quality is sustained. I've been able to see the kind of jobs I foresee myself doing in the future, and it has pushed me that much harder to try and achieve said future.</p>

                        <p>I've also learned a lot of basic life skills like time management, responsibility, reporting properly and in a professional and effective manner, documentation of various procedures and reports, communicating with managers and fellow co-workers to ensure unity amongst all employees, and many other skills. This type of experience is hard to get, and I was very fortunate to have been given this opportunity.</p>

                        <p>On top of that, I've been able to learn a lot about the drone itself, as I was flight trained for a day, brought out to the field numerous times to physically fly the drone across my two months, and actually making components of the drone. It was all in all a very rewarding experience and I hope to return next summer to continue with this journey with Aeryon.</p>

                            <h2>Soccer Referee for the Waterloo Minor Soccer Association</h2>
                        </header>

                        <p>I've been officiating soccer for nearly four years now, and I've truly seen it all. From players brawling, to coaches yelling at each other or myself, to even parents arguing. Each situation requires different protocols and actions from myself as the referee, and this really has developed me as a person to know how to deal with tough situations, with physical situations, or situations that are getting out of hand. On top of this decision making, I've learned simply skills like time management, responsibility, enforcing rules, determination, leadership and teamwork, when working with assistant referees.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, over my four years, I've dealt with almost every age you can think of. I've dealt with players aging from 8 years old to 18 years old, coaches aging from mid 20's to 50's, and parents of all ages. This type of experience is not easily achieved, and took years for me to fine tune.</p>

                        <p>One of the main responsibilities of me as a referee, both assistant referee or main referee, is to ensure the safety of the players. This comes in multiple ways, making sure the game doesn't get out of hand (calling fouls from the start, and now allowing it to escalate till you begin calling), making sure the coaches and parents are well handled and are not angry (this also comes with making the correct calls) and calming the players down in a respectful manner when you see them getting angry.</p>

                        <p>Overall, refereeing soccer has been one of the best jobs I could have asked for, and I will continue to referee as long as I can.</p>
